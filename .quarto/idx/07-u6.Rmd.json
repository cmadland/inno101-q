Just have a look at the [TWU website](https://www.twu.ca/){target=\"_blank\"} and you will find several references to learning within a community.  For example,  \n\n> \"At Trinity Western University, you'll experience an authentic and engaging community as you enrich your understanding of the world—preparing for a life of faithful engagement in your community and profession. We are deeply committed to providing a transformational education, where you will develop practical professional skills while exploring bigger ideas about who you are, what you believe, and what you're called to do in the world.\" [TWU website](https://www.twu.ca/){target=\"_blank\"}\n\nWhy is community so important to TWU, and how does it help us learn?  Have a quick read of [TWU's Core Values](https://www.twu.ca/about-us/commitments/core-values){target=\"_blank\"}.  At this point in the course, we hope you have taken full advantage of the online community and have personal examples of how these interactions have impacted you.\n\nAs for learning...how does sharing our learning within a community help us achieve our personal and professional goals? \n\nThere are several social learning theories and practicies that explain how social interactions impact our learning (e.g. Situated Learning, Social Constructivism, Connectivism, Cooperative and Collaborative Learning, Communities of Inquiry, etc.) If you're interested, feel free to look up these terms online or use tools, such as LitMaps.  \n\nIn this course we have promoted the use of tools that allow you to share your learning online: Discourse, Hypothes.is, and WordPress.  Our goal is to help you utilize technology to discover and share knowledge, collaborate with others, and become engaged digital global citizens.  In the next activity, we ask you to reflect on your learning experiences and your goals.\n\n### Activity: Learning in Community {-}\n\n```{block2, type='reflect'}\n\nBelow are several resources that explain how we learn in community.\n\n- [Social Learning in Online Environments](https://openpress.usask.ca/humanmooc/chapter/social-learning-in-online-environments/){target=\"_blank\"} \n- [Social Learning Theories](https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Education_and_Professional_Development/Teaching_Crowds_-_Learning_and_Social_Media_(Dron_and_Anderson)/02%3A_Social_Learning_Theories){target=\"_blank\"} \n- [Social networking, knowledge sharing, and student learning: The case of university students](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360131516300872){target=\"_blank\"} \n- [Collaborative Learning in Higher Education: Evoking Positive Interdependence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5132366/){target=\"_blank\"} \n\nWatch [What is social learning?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB-_822TRms){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n<div class =\"video-container\">\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AB-_822TRms\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n\n</div>\n\nAt TWU, you may be asked to participate in various group activities, such as group work, partner projects, team presentations, etc.  Have a look at this resource that explains examples and reasons for these activities: [Group work: Using cooperative learning groups effectively](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/setting-up-and-facilitating-group-work-using-cooperative-learning-groups-effectively/){target=\"_blank\"} \n\nStudents also have the opportunity to share their learning beyond the classroom. Here are some examples highlighting student collaboration and sharing at TWU:  \n- [TWU Media + Communications students showcase their work at student film festival, Cinergy 2023](https://www.twu.ca/news-events/news/twu-media-communications-students-showcase-their-work-student-film-festival){target=\"_blank\"}   \n- [Students Attend the Western Division of Canadian Association of Geographers](https://www.twu.ca/research/student-research/news){target=\"_blank\"} \n\n\nWhat do you think? How have you experienced social learning in your educational experiences?  How did it help or hinder your learning? What are your goals for sharing your learning in your TWU classes and beyond? Share your thoughts by posting a comment on Discourse, for example: \"Sharing learning in academica is valuable because ...\"\n\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n### Activity: Preparing For the Future  {-}\n\n```{block2, type='reflect'}\n\nThroughout your studies at TWU you will share your learning with instructors, your peers, and the community.  You will also practice and master various skills, including digital skills, leadership skills, communication skills, and critical thinking skills.  Why are these important?  Take a look at the image below that depicts the Top 10 Employee Skills for 2025.  How do your studies and activities at TWU prepare you to meet those necessary skills?  \n\n![Top 10 Employee Skills for 2025](assets/u6/Top Employee Skills 2025.png)\n\n\nTWU has a [Centre for Calling & Career Development](https://www.twu.ca/academics/academic-professional-support/centre-calling-career-development) that aims to equip students for their future careers.  Have a look at their Career Ready Framework in the graphic below.\n\n\n![Career Ready Framework](assets/u6/Competency Framework.png) \n\nWhat competencies do you see that relate to social learning and digital skills?  As this course aims to prepare you for the technology skills that are needed in this digital age, we also want to encourage you to develop personal and professional learning networks to discover and share knowledge, collaborate with others, and become engaged digital global citizens.  \n\nConsider the following questions:\n- What skills and competencies do you want to practice to be successful in your future career?\n- How does collaborative learning and sharing your learning contribute to your learning journey?\n\nFeel free to share your thoughts in your Obsidian journal, Discourse, or your Wordpress blog.\n\n\n```\n\n\n## Digital Practices in the Workplace  \n\nLet's fast forward a couple years to a time when you graduate from Trinity - fully equipped with the knowledge, skills, character, and creativity to make a lasting impact in the world. What digital skills will you have to prepare you for your future career?  \nIn this topic we consider how changes in technology have and will continue to impact digital practices in the workplace.  Pause and consider the following questions:\n\n- How do professionals in your field of interest network online?  \n- How has technology changed business practices in your field of interest or career?  \n- What are the implications for learning and skills development in your future career precipitated by changes in digital technology?  \n\n### Activity: The Future of Work {-}\n\n```{block2, type='reflect'}\n\nIn this short video, [Ken Steele](http://eduvation.ca/bio/){target=\"_blank\"} from Eduvation speculates about the future of the labour market and the value of higher education in a digital age.\n\nWatch [Higher Ed Trends: Student Career Anxiety and the Future of Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4UhfQefdU){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n\n<div class =\"video-container\">\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iY4UhfQefdU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n\n</div>\n\n\nWhat do you think? Share your thoughts by posting a comment on Discourse, for example:\n\nHigher ed is valuable because ...  \n- In a digital age ...  \n- I am confident that ...  \n- I am concerned about ...  \n\n```\n\n\n### Technology and Change {-}\n\nThroughout history, there are technologies which have influenced change in society. Consider for example, the invention of the steam engine and its contribution to the Industrial Revolution. In more recent times, the advent of digital photography displaced Kodachrome (at one time, the market leader in colour film sales) which ceased production in 2009.\n\n\n### Activity: Newspaper and Music Industry in a Digital Age  {-}\n\n```{block2, type='reflect'}\n\nThe readings which follow take a retrospective look at the impact of the Internet on the newspaper and music industries.\n\nPlease add or reply to annotations using [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/){target=\"_blank\"} sharing personal insights and experiences.

Examples include, autonomous cars, computers understanding human speech and machine learning. Consider for instance, that computer chess games available for commercial desktop machines have the ability to beat accomplished chess players including grand masters.  And of course, Chat GPT.  \n\nIn this section we introduce a few interesting examples of artificial intelligence to provide a sense of how sophisticated these technologies are becoming.\n\nFirst, let's define AI:\n\n> \"The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages\" ([Oxford Reference](https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095426960){target=\"_blank\"})\n\n> \"The capacity of a computer to perform operations analogous to learning and decision making in humans, as by an expert system, a program for CAD or CAM, or a program for the perception and recognition of shapes in computer vision systems\" ([Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/artificial-intelligence){target=\"_blank\"})\n\nWhat is your experience with AI?  Have you used an AI tool, such as Grammerly or ChatGPT? How has this technology affected you as a student, and what effect do you think it has/will have on your chosen profession?  \n\nIn the next activity, we'll explore some of these questions and concerns.\n\n\n### Activity: How Can I Use AI as a Student? {-}\n\n```{block2, type='reflect'}\n\nFirst, do a quick search online for AI tools for university students. \nExamples:  \n- [How can AI be used by university students?](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/advice/how-can-ai-be-used-university-students){target=\"_blank\"}    \n- [The 10 Best AI Tools to Help Students Learn Faster](https://mystudylife.com/10-best-ai-tools-to-help-students-learn-faster/){target=\"_blank\"}    \n\nIntrigued? Do you find any tech tools that would be useful in understanding course topics, studying, generating flashcards, transcribing lectures and voice notes, correcting grammar, writing an essay, creating a slideshow presentation, drafting a forum discussion post, etc.?\n\nDo any of these capabilites concern you?  Do you think they concern your professors or fellow students? \n\nReview TWU's policy on [Academic Misconduct & Fraud](https://www.twu.ca/about-us/policies-guidelines/university-policies/academic-misconduct-fraud){target=\"_blank\"}.   Is it Academic Fraud if you use Chat GPT to complete assignments?  \n\nSearch online for key words related to this issue, such as \"university concern policy artificial intelligence\" and you will find numerous articles on the use of AI in universities, as well as emerging policies.  For example, the University of Toronto's guidelines for [ChatGPT and Generative AI in the Classroom](https://www.viceprovostundergrad.utoronto.ca/strategic-priorities/digital-learning/special-initiative-artificial-intelligence/){target=\"_blank\"}\n\nHere are some guidelines you may receive from your instructors at TWU:\n\n• Students are encouraged to make use of technology, including generative artificial intelligence\ntools, to contribute to their understanding of course materials.\n• Students must submit, as an appendix with their assignments, any content produced by an\nartificial intelligence tool, and the prompt used to generate the content.\n• Any content produced by an artificial intelligence tool must be cited appropriately. Many\norganizations that publish standard citation formats are now providing information on citing\ngenerative AI (e.g., MLA: https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai/){target=\"_blank\"}.  \n• Students may use artificial intelligence tools for creating an outline for an assignment, but the\nfinal submitted assignment must be original work produced by the individual student alone.  \n• Students may not use artificial intelligence tools for taking tests, writing research papers,\ncreating computer code, or completing major course assignments. However, these tools may be\nuseful when gathering information from across sources and assimilating it for understanding.  \n\nIf you have any question about the use of AI applications for course work, please speak with your instructor.\n\nNext, watch [How AI Could Save (Not Destroy) Education | Sal Khan | TED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJP5GqnTrNo)\n\n<div class =\"video-container\">\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hJP5GqnTrNo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n\n</div>\n\nHere is one more article that discusses the pros and cons for English Learners using AI in their studies: [Perspectives of the Use of ChatGPT as a Tool for Online Education of English](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374483468_Perspectives_of_the_Use_of_ChatGPT_as_a_Tool_for_Online_Education_of_English){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n\n```\n\n### Activity: How To Identify AI Generated Text {-}\n\n```{block2, type='reflect'}\n\nExplore the infographic below by Ryan Morrison.\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%;\"><div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 0; height: 0;\"><iframe title=\"AI Generated Text\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"1200px\" height=\"675px\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" src=\"https://view.genial.ly/63753092992318001811d46f\" type=\"text/html\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" scrolling=\"yes\" allownetworking=\"all\"></iframe> </div> </div>\n\nConsider trying out ChatGPT to see if you can spot the ways to identify AI generated writing.\n\nNext, watch the video from Mark Lyda [Plagiarizing ChatGPT - Is it Illegal?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuvN8_6QIKk)\n\n\n<div class =\"video-container\">\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zuvN8_6QIKk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n\n</div>\n\nOptional resource: [ChatGPT and artificial intelligence in higher education: quick start guide](https://www.iesalc.unesco.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ChatGPT-and-Artificial-Intelligence-in-higher-education-Quick-Start-guide_EN_FINAL.pdf) (Sabzalieva & Valentini, 2023).\n\n```\n\n\n### Jobs and Automation {-}\n\nIn this section we consider the impact of automation on the future job market and the implications for education and training.

This activity focuses on how AI moderates harmful content.  How does AI know what is harmful? Since AI tools are built on all kinds of information, including harmful and hateful content, how is this content identified?  \n\nAI systems require lots of work from humans to function correctly. A 2023 report from Time magazine showed that people in Kenya were paid poverty wages to build a safety system into ChatGPT. Since the platform was fed data from various places sometimes it would make racist or abusive remarks. To build a safeguard into the system, workers were exposed to vile and offensive web content in order to tag it so that the platform could eventually recognize offensive speech all on its own. A large portion of this content was very traumatic, and workers interviewed said they were mentally scarred from the work.\n\nRead the following articles: \n\n- [OpenAI Used Kenyan Workers on Less Than $2 Per Hour to Make ChatGPT Less Toxic](https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/) by Billy Perrigo published in Time (January 18, 2023).\n- [Inside Facebook's African Sweatshop](https://time.com/6147458/facebook-africa-content-moderation-employee-treatment/) by Billy Perrigo published in Time (Feburary 14, 2020).\n\nFinally, watch the video, [Doing Grueling Work for an AI: Data Labeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug_p2wHhla0)\n\n\n<div class =\"video-container\">\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ug_p2wHhla0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n\n</div>\n\n**Questions to Consider**:\n\n- Is it ethical to submit those Kenyan workers to trauma in order to sanitize ChatGPT for other users? \n- What other solutions are there for training AI to moderate content? \n\nShare you thoughts on AI by posting a comment on Discourse, for example:\n\n- AI will ...  \n- I was surprised that AI ...  \n- In <insert business> AI will ...  \n\n```\n\n\n\n## Societal Issues and the Internet \n\nIn this next topic, we introduce a number of societal issues and problematic online behaviors that have emerged in the digital world. Our list is not comprehensive and does not provide a thorough examination of the issues. Here, we encourage you to choose an issue for further investigation.\n\nYou will choose one societal issue or antisocial behavior associated with the Internet that you would like to investigate further and publish as an editorial in your course blog. You will base your focus on your reading of open access resources you find online.

Below we will give an overview of how website tracking works, how your data is used, and how you can protect yourself online.\n\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>**How does website tracking work?**</summary>  \n\n**Cookies**: Cookies are small text files that websites store on your device. They contain information about your online activities, such as login credentials, preferences, and browsing history. Websites use cookies to recognize and remember you when you return, and they can also track your movements across the site.\n\n**IP Address Tracking**: Every device connected to the internet has a unique IP address. Websites can log and analyze these addresses to determine a user's approximate location and to track their visits.\n\n**Analytics Tools**: Many websites use analytics tools like Google Analytics to monitor user behavior. These tools track which pages you visit, how long you stay on each page, and how you arrived at the website (e.g., through a search engine or a referral from another site). This data helps website owners optimize their content and user experience.\n\n**Ad Trackers**: Advertisers and ad networks use various techniques to track your online behavior. They place cookies on your device, which allows them to follow your movements across multiple websites. This data is used to deliver personalized ads based on your interests and browsing history.\n\n**Social Media Widgets**: Social media buttons and widgets on websites can track your activity, even if you don't click on them. They often use this information to build a profile of your interests and habits.\n\n**Fingerprinting**: Fingerprinting is a technique that collects data about your device and browser configuration, such as your screen resolution, installed fonts, and plugins. This information can be used to create a unique identifier for your device and track your online activities.\n\n**Location Data**: Many websites request access to your device's location information. This can be used to provide location-based services, but it also allows websites to track your physical movements.\n\n**Data Brokers**: Your data may be collected, aggregated, and sold to data brokers who build detailed profiles about individuals. These profiles can include your demographic information, interests, and online behavior.\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>**How is my data used when I use the internet?**</summary>   \n\n**Personalization**: Websites and online services use the data they collect to personalize your experience. For example, they may recommend products, content, or services based on your browsing history and preferences.\n\n**Targeted Advertising**: Advertisers use your data to show you ads that are more likely to be relevant to your interests. This is how you might see ads for products you've recently searched for online.\n\n**Analytics and Optimization**: Website owners use tracking data to improve their websites and services, making them more user-friendly and effective.\n\n**Market Research**: Aggregated user data is often used for market research and to identify trends and consumer preferences.\n\n**Data Profiling**: Your data may be used to build detailed profiles about you. These profiles can be used for a variety of purposes, including credit scoring, job recruiting, and targeted marketing.\n\n**Security and Fraud Prevention**: Tracking data can also be used for security purposes, helping to detect and prevent fraudulent activities.\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>**What are the privacy concerns?**</summary>  \n\nPrivacy concerns regarding website tracking primarily revolve around the collection and use of personal data without the explicit consent of users. Here are some key privacy concerns and ways in which users can protect themselves from tracking:\n\n**Invasion of Privacy**: Website tracking can create a detailed profile of an individual's online behavior, which may include sensitive information such as health concerns, financial status, or personal interests. This can be seen as an invasion of privacy.\n\n**Data Breaches**: When your data is collected and stored by multiple parties, there is an increased risk of data breaches. If a hacker gains access to a company's database that stores user data, your personal information may be exposed.\n\n**Targeted Advertising**: While some users appreciate personalized ads, others find them intrusive and a form of manipulation. The extensive tracking of online behavior allows advertisers to deliver highly targeted ads, which can feel invasive.\n\n**Third-Party Sharing**: Data collected by websites is often shared with third-party companies, including data brokers and ad networks. Users may not be aware of who has access to their data and how it's used.\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>**How can I protect myself from tracking?**</summary>  \n\n**Use Privacy-Focused Browsers**: Consider using web browsers that prioritize user privacy, such as Mozilla Firefox or the Tor Browser. These browsers often include built-in tracking protection features.\n\n**Browser Extensions**: Install browser extensions or add-ons like uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, and HTTPS Everywhere, which can block tracking cookies, scripts, and enhance your online security.\n\n**Opt-Out Options**: Some websites and advertising networks provide options to opt out of personalized ads. You can often find these settings in the privacy sections of websites or through industry-specific opt-out platforms, like the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA).\n\n**Use a VPN**: A Virtual Private Network (VPN) can hide your IP address and encrypt your internet traffic, making it more challenging for websites to track your location and online activities.\n\n**Cookie Settings**: Adjust your browser's cookie settings to block third-party cookies. You can choose to accept cookies only from visited websites, which limits tracking across different sites.\n\n**Use Private Browsing Modes**: Most browsers offer private or incognito modes that don't store your browsing history or cookies. While this doesn't provide complete anonymity, it limits tracking to a single session.\n\n**Search Engines**: Consider using privacy-focused search engines like DuckDuckGo or Startpage, which do not track your search queries.\n\n**Review App Permissions**: On mobile devices, review and restrict the permissions granted to apps, including location access. Some apps collect more data than necessary for their core functionality.\n\n**Regularly Clear Cookies**: Periodically clear your browser's cookies and browsing history to remove tracking data that has been collected over time.\n\n**Educate Yourself**: Stay informed about online privacy and data protection practices. Understand the privacy policies of websites and services you use, and be cautious about sharing personal information online.\n\n**Consider VPNs and Encrypted Messaging**: For heightened privacy, use end-to-end encrypted messaging apps like Signal and consider using a reputable VPN service to protect your online communication.\n\nIt's important to note that while these steps can help reduce online tracking, they may not completely eliminate it. Achieving complete anonymity on the internet is challenging, but these measures can significantly enhance your online privacy and data security. Additionally, privacy laws and regulations in your region may provide you with rights and options for controlling how your data is collected and used online.\n\n\n### Activity: Website Tracking Resources  {-}\n\n```{block2, type='reflect'}\n\n**Choose from the resources below to inform your views on website and data tracking:** \n- [The Real Cost of the ‘Free’ Internet](http://mediashift.org/2018/01/real-cost-free-internet/){target=\"_blank\"}  \n- [Stop Saying ‘If You’re Not Paying, You’re The Product’](https://www.techdirt.com/2012/12/20/stop-saying-if-youre-not-paying-youre-product/){target=\"_blank\"}\n- Krutka, D.G., Smits, R.M., and Willhelm, T.A.

There are costs that need to be covered to sustain the OERu: for example, the assembly of open online courses, hosting of the server and software infrastructure, staff to coordinate and support the initiative. etc. The OERu does not generate any revenue from corporate services, by, for example, allowing advertising on the OERu course sites for a share of the advertising revenue. Moreover, the OERu does not sell or generate revenue from personal data learners provide by using these free learning services, therefore users are not the product of this service.   \n\n**Discussion**\n\nJoin the discussion on philanthropy and corporate advertising. The key question is how can non-profit organisations sustain free educational services for those who can’t afford traditional education provision?\n\nConsider the following issues:\n\n- As a learner, how would you feel if the course materials included corporate advertising? If advertising were to be supported, how would you feel if the OERu course sites required you to switch off any ad-blockers before gaining access to the course materials?  \n- Is it appropriate for publicly funded institutions and charities working in education to generate revenue from corporate advertising to support and sustain free online services? What are the risks and opportunities?    \n- Should education institutions and educational charities accept significant corporate sponsorship in return for profiling proprietary products?  \n- The OERu has recommended that learners use free blogging services to share their learning outputs. Many of these services carry advertising. How do you feel about using these services – being the product rather than consumer? Would it be better for OERu to recommend that learners use a paid service without advertising? How would this impact on learners who do not have sufficient funds to afford maintaining a domain of their own?  \n- Other?  \n\nRemember to tag your posts using the course code: LDRS101\n\n```\n\n### Online Impersonation \n\nImpersonation online refers to the act of creating an online presence in someone else’s name. This is potentially a complex issue as some social media sites permit parody accounts or accounts that are intended to represent real individuals. It is not necessarily illegal to impersonate someone per se, for example comedy, but online impersonation is a growing problem.

The future is still so much bigger than the past.”*\n>\n>***— Time Berners-Lee***\n\nThe World Wide Web was originally designed to provide universal access to a large universe of documents. To achieve universal access, it was paramount to design the web as an open system without a central locus of control. However, on the Internet there are an increasing number of “walled gardens” that aim to control user’s access to content and services. In this section we explore the concept of net neutrality and reflect on the risks associated with universal access to online information.\n\n***Net neutrality*** is a critical concept in the realm of internet policy and regulation. It revolves around the principle that internet service providers (ISPs) should treat all data on the internet equally. In other words, they should not discriminate against or charge differently based on user, content, website, application, or platform. The primary goal of net neutrality is to ensure that the internet remains an open and level playing field, where all data and information can be accessed and transmitted freely.\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>**Arguments For Net Neutrality**</summary>  \n\n- *Preservation of Open Internet*: Net neutrality proponents argue that it is essential to maintain the open nature of the internet, where all content is equally accessible to users. This fosters innovation, competition, and free expression.  \n- *Equal Access*: Net neutrality ensures that users, regardless of their economic status, can access all online content without discrimination. It prevents ISPs from creating fast lanes for certain content, disadvantaging others.  \n- *Innovation*: Without net neutrality, ISPs could prioritize certain services or websites, potentially stifling innovation by making it difficult for new, smaller players to compete on a level playing field.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>**Arguments Against Net Neutrality**</summary> \n\n- *Investment and Infrastructure*: Opponents argue that without the ability to offer paid prioritization or tiered services, ISPs may have less incentive to invest in and improve network infrastructure, potentially hindering the growth of broadband services.  \n- *Regulatory Overreach*: Some argue that government intervention in net neutrality is unnecessary and that market forces should determine how ISPs manage their networks. They fear that regulation could lead to unintended consequences, such as the governent controling access to online content.   \n- *Quality of Service*: In certain cases, ISPs claim that they need the flexibility to manage network traffic to provide a better quality of service for applications such as real-time video and gaming.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>**Key Concerns**</summary> \n\nConcerns surrounding net neutrality involve potential discrimination, a lack of competition, and the profound implications for free speech and innovation. The absence of robust net neutrality principles could pave the way for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to exert unwarranted control. They might throttle or obstruct access to specific websites, promote their own content, or levy extra charges for particular online services.\n\nAt the same time, there is a significant concern of government overreach in this digital domain. The debate over how much the government should regulate the internet is a hot topic, as it could hamper innovation and limit the free sharing of information. Excessive regulation could put the power to control or tamper with online content in the hands of the government or regulators, potentially jeopardizing our democratic values and our basic freedom of expression. Navigating this tricky balance between rules and protecting our personal freedoms is a key challenge in the digital era.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>**Canadian Context**</summary> \n\nIn Canada, the discussion on net neutrality is intertwined with the debate over Bill C-10, also known as the Broadcasting Act. This bill, introduced in 2021, aims to update Canada's broadcasting and telecommunications regulations to account for the digital age. Critics of Bill C-10 have expressed concerns that it could infringe on net neutrality principles by giving more power to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to regulate online content, potentially leading to restrictions on free expression and innovation.\n\nIn addition to Bill C-10, another significant piece of legislation to consider in the Canadian context is Bill C-18, which is also known as the Online Streaming Act. This bill, introduced to the Canadian Parliament, is designed to regulate online streaming services, potentially affecting the content and accessibility of such platforms. Critics argue that Bill C-18 could raise concerns related to net neutrality by granting the government more authority over the content available on streaming platforms and potentially infringing on free expression and access to diverse content.\n\n</details>\n\n<br>\n\n**Questions to Consider:**  \nAs you view the resources in the activity below, consider the following questions:  \n- How does the principle of net neutrality impact the way you access and use the internet, and how might changes in net neutrality regulations affect your online experience?  \n- What is the role of government and regulatory bodies, such as the CRTC in Canada, in ensuring a balance between net neutrality and the need to regulate online content and services?  \n- What measures can be taken to ensure that government regulations, while addressing valid concerns, do not lead to the overreach of power and the erosion of fundamental rights, such as free speech, on the internet?  \n- Can net neutrality coexist with the goal of ensuring high-quality internet service and fostering investment in digital infrastructure, or are these objectives inherently in conflict?\n\nConsider drawing a mind map, such as the following to track your understanding of the subject.\n\n<a title=\"Net Neutrality And Creative Freedom (Tim Wu at re:publica 2010)\" href=\"https://flickr.com/photos/frauleinschiller/4540678705\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/2790/4540678705_ff7936561a.jpg\" alt=\"Net Neutrality And Creative Freedom (Tim Wu at re:publica 2010)\" /></a><br /><small><a title=\"Net Neutrality And Creative Freedom (Tim Wu at re:publica 2010)\" href=\"https://flickr.com/photos/frauleinschiller/4540678705\">Net Neutrality And Creative Freedom (Tim Wu at re:publica 2010)</a> flickr photo by <a href=\"https://flickr.com/people/frauleinschiller\">Anna L.

Browse through his [articles on Net Neutrality](https://www.michaelgeist.ca/tech-law-topics/net-neutrality/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nHere are some key points of interest from Dr. Geist:  \n\n> \"while the focus of net neutrality is typically on telecom companies, Bill C-10 envisions a different intermediary or third party – the Canadian government via the CRTC – choosing which content Canadians see by prioritizing or de-prioritizing content that appears in Canadians’ feeds. Internet sites and services will still be available to Canadians (assuming the sites aren’t blocked given the onerous regulations), but the government’s Internet regulatory framework will mean that Internet content will not be treated in a neutral, equal fashion. The mandated Canadian content discoverability requirements will mean that a government regulator will influence what Canadians see when they access Internet services, invoking the same concerns regarding interfering with content and user choice. The intermediary may have changed, but the principle is largely the same.\" (from [Why Bill C-10 Undermines the Government’s Commitment to the Principle of Net Neutrality](https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2021/05/why-bill-c-10-undermines-the-governments-commitment-to-the-principle-of-net-neutrality/){target=\"_blank\"})\n\n> It is hard to overstate how dangerous it would be for the CRTC to be vested with new powers to regularly intervene in online content or consider “conditions of service” for Internet sites and services. While the government insists that Bill C-11 is designed for large streaming services with limited regulations, it would appear that the CRTC may have other ideas. (from [CRTC Calls for Increased Powers To Take a More “Interventionist” Approach on Internet Content](https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2022/03/crtc-calls-for-more-powers-to-take-a-more-interventionist-approach-on-internet-content/){target=\"_blank\"} (March 3, 2022))\n\n> \"it is difficult to separate the government’s willingness to censor social media posts with its broader Internet regulation agenda, including Bills C-11, C-18 and online harms. Seeking to remove news links, mean tweets and other content without due process and without any apparent illegality does not bode well for the development of Charter-compliant regulations. The government may see itself as a model for others, but its willingness to muscle social media companies in an effort to remove lawful content is the very worst kind of example that should not be welcome in a democracy that prioritizes freedom of expression.\" (from [Government Departments Pressure Social Media Sites to Censor News Links, Mean Tweets](https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2023/04/government-departments-pressure-social-media-sites-to-censor-news-links-mean-tweets/){target=\"_blank\"} (April 13, 2023))\n\n\nAnother interesting perspective on the issue comes from [Digital First Canada](https://digitalfirstcanada.ca/fix-c11/){target=\"_blank\"} a non profit organization that advocates on behalf of the Digital Entrepreneurs in Canada. Here is there explanation of Bill C-11: \n\nIn its current form, Bill C-11 gives the CRTC authority to:\n\n- Dictate how and where your content appears on digital platforms.   \n- Affect your discoverability by artificially promoting some creators over others. Viewers may be pushed to watch content they aren't interested in, resulting in more skips and thumbs down, which would impact how your content is exported to global audiences, lowering viewership and revenue.   \n- Apply complex “CanCon” rules that require you to prove your content is “Canadian” enough. This is easy for large Canadian media companies with teams who have been following these rules for decades, and makes it harder for smaller creators to benefit from any financial or promotional gain.  \n- Push your content down in feeds if it doesn’t meet CanCon requirements.  \n- Regulate the length and type of advertising on your channel, which could mean less money in your pocket.  \n\n\nAccording to Digital First Canada, C-11 poses a threat to those who want to post their content online.  The state the following principles:   \n\n- Digital First Creators do not require government intervention to succeed. They have thrived and led a digital content renaissance without government intervention.   \n- Digital First Creators aspire for their content to be discovered by a global audience, and do not measure success within Canada’s borders.  \n- Freedom of expression is a fundamental freedom. Government should not interfere with or limit the ability for lawful content to be freely discovered by users.   \n- Canadian Content designations are incompatible with user generated content, and do not benefit the interests of Digital First Creators.  \n-  Any mandatory contributions derived from user-generated content platforms must be for the benefit of Digital First Creators who make content for those platforms.   \n\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>**Net Neutrality in America**</summary>  \n\n- [Net Neutrality is BACK!

It is an extension of the historical concept of redlining, which originally referred to the discriminatory practice of marking certain neighborhoods on physical maps and denying residents of those areas access to financial services, insurance, and other resources.\n\nIn the context of the digital age, digital redlining manifests in various ways:\n\n**Limited Internet Access**: Some areas, often low-income neighborhoods or rural regions, may lack access to high-speed internet or affordable data plans. This limits people's ability to access online education, job opportunities, government services, and other online resources.\n\n**Discriminatory Algorithms**: Algorithms used in various online services, such as lending, housing, and employment platforms, may inadvertently or intentionally discriminate against certain groups. For example, an algorithm may give preferential treatment to job applicants from specific demographics.\n\n**Targeted Advertising and Privacy Concerns**: Certain demographics may be disproportionately exposed to predatory or harmful online advertisements, while more privileged individuals receive personalized, less invasive content. This can lead to manipulation and exploitation.\n\n**Educational Disparities**: Inadequate access to technology and online educational resources can limit the learning opportunities for students in underserved communities.\n\n**Healthcare Access**: Some communities may have limited access to telehealth services, which have become increasingly important, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**Data Collection and Surveillance**: Vulnerable populations are often subject to more extensive data collection and surveillance, leading to privacy concerns and potential discrimination based on the data collected.\n\nAddressing digital redlining is essential to ensure equitable access to the benefits of the digital age. Efforts to combat digital redlining include policies aimed at closing the digital divide, regulating algorithms to prevent discriminatory outcomes, promoting net neutrality, and protecting data privacy. These measures aim to create a more inclusive and fair digital environment for all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status, race, or location.\n\n\n### Activity: Case Study - Indigenous Communities in Canada {-}  \n\n```{block2, type='reflect'}\n\nDigital redlining is a global concern, including Canada. While Canada is known for its social safety nets and relatively high internet penetration rates, digital disparities persist, particularly among marginalized communities. These disparities are evident in various aspects, such as internet access, online discrimination, and algorithmic biases.\n\nWatch [Seneca Nation disconnected by Redlining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5NV9BJx1_M){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n<div class =\"video-container\">\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/J5NV9BJx1_M\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n\n</div>\n\n\nThis case study highlights the digital disparities faced by Indigenous communities in Canada. Many Indigenous communities, especially those in remote areas, lack reliable high-speed internet access, which hampers their ability to participate fully in the digital world. This limitation affects various aspects of life, including education, healthcare, economic opportunities, and cultural preservation.\n\nAddressing these issues in Canada requires a multi-faceted approach, combining infrastructure development, anti-discrimination regulations, and community engagement. Initiatives like the [Connecting Families program](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/connecting-families/en){target=\"_blank\"} and investments in broadband infrastructure are steps in the right direction, but more work is needed to ensure equitable access to the digital world for all Canadians. This includes recognizing the unique challenges faced by Indigenous communities and implementing policies that specifically address their needs while promoting digital inclusion and addressing digital redlining for all marginalized groups.\n\n```\n\n### Activity: Where Do You See Digital Redlining? {-}  \n\n```{block2, type='reflect'}\n\nAs you explore this topic, consider where digital redlining occurs in your community.

These three notions (diversity, equity, and inclusion) together represent \"three closely linked values\" which organizations seek to institutionalize through DEI frameworks.

As faculty members design their courses, they consider the needs of their students and how to effectively engage them in the course topics.  They recognize the diversity of students needs and viewpoints and seek to create an inclusive learning environment for students.  Instructors might use [Universal Design for Learning](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/), which is \"a framework to improve and optimize teaching and learning for all people based on scientific insights into how humans learn.\" Another teaching method they might employ is [Culturally Responsive Teaching](https://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/equality-inclusion-and-diversity/five-essential-strategies-to-embrace-culturally-responsive-teaching/) or [Culturally Responsive TeachingCulturally Relevant Pedagogy](http://www.inclusioncanada.net/culturallyrelevantpedagogy.html) as a way to use students' cultural experiences and perspectives as channels for effective teaching and learning (Gay, 2002). \n\nKey question: *Should instructors treat all students the same regardless of background, gender, beliefs, etc.?*\n\nMany academics in higher education hold this value of equality. Others promote equity, which \"takes into consideration a person’s unique circumstances, adjusting treatment accordingly so that the end result is equal\" ^[Reference: McKinsey & Company (2022, August 17).

Hospitality is vital to our life in the Trinity Western University community and to our life in and witness to other communities. \n\n> Practising Christian hospitality undergirds and promotes equity, diversity and inclusion.\n\n> - **Equity** is founded in our being created in the image of God; every human being has inherent dignity and worth (Gen 1:26-28; 5:1-2; Col 1:15).\n\n> - **Diversity** is inherent in God’s creation; it is good (Gen 1:11-12, 21-25).\n\n> - **Inclusion** is essential to the body of Christ; we are diverse and interdependent (1 Cor 12:12-31; Isa 56:3-8).\n\nAs you read [Practising Christian Hospitality](https://www.twu.ca/about-us/commitments/core-values/practising-christian-hospitality){target=\"_blank\"}, consider the following questions, and how they relate to your identity and actions online:\n\n- How do we advocate for the dignity of all human beings, and avoid any form of derogation or condescension?  \n- How do we value the differences and the diversity in God’s creation? \n- How do we live peaceably and productively in society in the midst of enduring differences, even on very significant matters?\n- Does being inclusive demand agreement or consensus?  \n- How can we practice Christian hospitality\n \n```\n\n\n<!--\ncomment\n\n### Fake News {-}\n\nadd intro\n\n### Activity: What is Fake News? {-}  \n\n```{block2, type='reflect'}\n\n<script src=\"https://h5pstudio.ecampusontario.ca/modules/contrib/h5p/vendor/h5p/h5p-core/js/h5p-resizer.js\" charset=\"UTF-8\"></script>\n\nChoose from the following resources to explore this topic further:\n\n- [Why it’s so easy to fall for fake news and how to spot it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF3TrTIZbCA)\n- [Censorship Run Amok: Covid, The Lab Leak, Masks & The Twitter Files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le0El7oEL8Q)\n \n\n\n```\n\ncomment\n\nadd intro?\n\nLibertarian journalist [John Stossel](https://www.johnstossel.com/) created Stossel TV(https://www.youtube.com/@StosselTV/about) to explain liberty and free markets to young people.  \n\n\"After 40+ years of reporting, I now understand the importance of limited government and personal freedom\" \n\n-->\n\nWe've explored a number of societal issues associated with the Internet.

In this section we explore digital rights management, geoblocking, and other examples. We highlight the importance users have to study the terms of reference and licenses when using proprietary software and buying products that rely on digital technology.\n\n**Mini Challenge Summary**\n\n**Summary:** Explore and discuss the impact of digital rights management. Time: 30–45 minutes. Consult the suggested resources and participate in the digital rights management debate.\n\n<span class=\"prote\">John Deere 9530 c.jpg</span>\n\n**Digital Rights Management (DRM):** Digital rights management (DRM) describes the practice of imposing technical restrictions (hardware or software) to restrict what users can do with the digital content or operation of their equipment. \n\n**Examples include:**\n\n- Film studios that embed software on their DVDs that restricts the number of copies a legal user can make to two.  \n- Computer games that restrict the number of devices on which the game can be installed requiring server authentication to keep track of the number of installations.  \n- e-Book publishers who restrict the ability to copy or print the materials.\n\n**Reading**\n\n- Layton, J. (Jan. 3, 2006). How Digital Rights Management Works. Retrieved July 4, 2017. (Click on the next button to progress the sub-pages of the article.)\n\n**Geoblocking:** Geoblocking is a form of DRM which restricts access to content based on geographical location; for example, restrictions associated with media rights for sport coverage or films in different parts of the world because copyright holders sell broadcast and distribution rights to different companies around the world. Frequently, prices for streamed services of the same content will differ from country to country.\n\nIn another example, an individual who buys DVD films in one country and then emigrates to another country, may find that the playback of the legally purchased content is restricted by technology means in the new country of residence.\n\n**Reading**\n\nGeoblocking from Wikipedia;\n\nEU lawmakers Include Spotify and iTunes in Geoblocking Ban from Reuters.\n\nCase study - The Right to Repair\n\nDo farmers have the right to repair their own tractors? Not necessarily, for example, John Deere’s proprietary software used to operate the vehicle does not allow “owners” to repair systems themselves and in effect they only have an implied license for life to operate the vehicle.\n\n**Readings**\n\nChoose one or two of the following readings (feel free to annotate using Hypothes.is and remember to tag your posts using the course code: lida102):\n\n- We Can’t Let John Deere Destroy the Very Idea of Ownership from Wired.\n- Why American Farmers are Hacking their own Tractors from the Guardian  \n- A Right to Repair: Why Nebraska Farmers are Taking on John Deere and Apple from the Guardian.  \n- The Fight for the “Right to Repair” from Smithsonian.com.  \n- Outputs  \n\n**Digital Rights Management Debate**\n\n- Seeing both sides of a debate gives you the opportunity to better understand the issues. In this discussion, choose one of  \n\n**the questions listed below and post to the DRM debate. Your post should include:**\n\n- A sentence summarizing the issue.  \n- The most important reason, in your opinion, why DRM is appropriate in a digital world.   \n- The most important reason, in your opinion, why DRM is not appropriate in a digital world.  \n\n<span class=\"blockhead\">Questions to Consider (optional)</span>\n\n- Do you have personal experience of a DRM issue? Summarize the example and present both sides of the issue.  \n- Do you have personal experience of a geoblocking issue?
