<h1>Discovering and Curating Resources</h1>
<section id="overview" class="level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this module, we’ll dive into three important aspects of utilizing digital resources effectively. Firstly, we’ll explore the art of discovering and selecting valuable resources for your academic and professional needs. You’ll learn how to search efficiently, critically assess sources for credibility and relevance, and fine-tune your search techniques.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll delve into the world of citation management. Properly citing your sources is vital in academic writing to avoid plagiarism, and we’ll introduce you to various citation styles like APA, MLA, and Chicago. You’ll also gain practical experience with citation management tools to help streamline the citation process and manage your references efficiently.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ll discuss the concept of openness in education. We’ll explore open educational resources (OER), the benefits and challenges of open access, and the role of Creative Commons licenses in educational materials. This discussion will open your eyes to the changing landscape of educational resources and the ethics surrounding them. Throughout these topics, you’ll engage in hands-on activities, group projects, and discussions to enhance your critical thinking skills and promote responsible use of digital resources.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="finding-and-selecting-resources">Finding and Selecting Resources</h2>
<p>Throughout your university career, you will encounter tasks in your courses that will require you to produce some original writing. It is very important that you give yourself more time than you think you might need to complete these tasks. Good writing in university doesn’t just happen. It takes work. You will find that a large amount of that work isn’t actually writing at all, but reading. Then writing, and reading some more. Then re-writing, revising, editing, reading some more, and editing again.</p>
<p>One of the most important tasks in all that, is finding the resources you need to read, making sure they are <em>academic</em> resources, copying down all the information about the resource, then making sure you can keep track of what you have found, read, and learned. This unit will help you build a workflow for doing just that. You need a workflow and a system, because there is far too much information available to you than you will ever be able to digest and read, let alone remember. It is impossible to memorize everything you need to know, so you need a way to manage your knowledge and resources.</p>
<p>In the previous unit, we introduced you to Obsidian, and you are going to continue to use Obsidian in this unit, but we will add some awareness of features that will take you along the path of becoming a workflow wizard. We will also introduce two new tools, Litmaps and Zotero, along with a couple of Zotero plugins that help extend the capabilities of the software. We will also integrate some knowledge of how to use the library to assist.</p>
<p>We recognize that we are introducing several tools to you, and that may feel overwhelming, however, there are no tools that do everything that you need to do, and if a tool claims to be able to do everything, it likely does only a few things well, and the rest is poorly implemented.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="finding-resources">Finding Resources</h3>
<p>Litmaps is a web app that you can use to build a map of the literature regarding your topic. For now, presume that you need to write a paper on transformational servant leadership. That is a very broad topic, and you are only beginning to learn about it, so you need to start by doing some reading…but what should you read? Your instructor might have given you an article to read, or there are likely some good articles published on your course syllabus, but you might also have to start on your own. Here is how.</p>
<section id="find-a-literature-review" class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="find-a-literature-review">Find a Literature Review</h4>
<p>When academics begin writing a research paper, they always start by reviewing what is already known about a subject, in this case, transformational servant leadership. This is called a literature review, and you can often find a section called “Literature Review” at the beginning of every article you read. Sometimes, though, the whole research article will be a literature review. Reviewing the literature in this way is sometimes called a systematic review, or maybe a scoping review. These approaches to lit reviews have different foci, but the intent is to publish an article that follows very specific procedures so that other researchers or learners can confirm the process. These types of reviews are very useful in getting started in a new topic.</p>
<p>One of the quickest ways to get started on a search is to use <a href="https://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar (scholar.google.com)</a>, but Google Scholar has some problems in that it will return a huge number of results. Notice that the image below shows over 91,000 results. Far too many for you to sort through.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="assets/u2/google-search1.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Screenshot of the results page of a Google Scholar search for “Transformational servant leadership”</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The top result, shows some promise though. Notice a few things about it.</p>
<ul>
<li>it has all your key words right in the title - that’s good</li>
<li>it has over 2700 citations (that’s very good)</li>
<li>it was published in 2004 (that’s not great…it’s old)</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the easiest ways to find literature reviews in Google searches is to include ‘literature review’ in your search. When we do that, we get a better list. This time, there are more results (97,000), but they are better results. Notice the third item…</p>

<li>lots of citations</li>
<li>much more recent (2019)</li>
<li>AND it is a systematic review</li>

<p>In fact, you don’t even need to read this article yet. All you need is the DOI - the <em>Digital Object Identifier</em>. A DOI is a critical piece of information about an article that provides a piece of evidence that this is a legitimate article published in a legitimate journal. A DOI will always start with <code>10.</code>. Sometimes, it is included as part of a URL, like in this case, but you only need the code that follows ‘10.’. The DOI for this article is <code>10.1016/j.leaqua.2018.07.004</code></p>
<p>Copy the DOI. Sometimes you need to copy the whole URL, and that is ok.</p>

<p>Paste the DOI.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>You will notice that LitMaps will be able to find the article and will present it as an option for you to click. Go ahead…click.</p>
<p>LitMaps will create what they call a <code>Seed Map</code>, which you can see in the image below.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="assets/u2/litmaps2.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Screenshot of the Litmaps.com seed map</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The seed map shows an AI-generated map of the 20 most relevant articles related to the seed article. Each dot represents an article. The seed article is shown as a dot with a little sprout in the middle. The size of the dot is related to how many references are in the article (smaller dot = fewer references). Dots near the top of the map have more citations, and dots near the right side of the map are more recent. The map will always look like a bit of a waterfall as older articles tend to have more citations. This map can be very helpful in finding very impactful, recent articles as those articles will be in the top right quadrant of the map.</p>
<p>When you are signed in to LitMaps, you are able to create ‘Collections’ of articles. To do this, click on an article in the seed map, then read through the abstract. This might tell you that the article is not related to your search, but if it is, as in the image, then click ‘Edit Collections’ then ‘New Collection’. Give the new collection a name, and click ‘Done’.</p>

<p>Next, add Hoch, 2018 to your new collection (it is closest to the upper right quadrant), and finally add Greenleaf, 1979 (all the articles seem to cite this article, so it is likely very important in the field, sometimes called a ‘seminal article’).</p>
<p>Notice that the articles you added to your new collection are all coloured the same as the collection.</p>

<p>Click ‘Your Library’ and choose the library you just created. There should be 8 or so references in the library.

<li>Review your draft research question taking into account:<br>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><em>Personal interest</em>: Does the research question interest you?<br>
</li>
<li><em>Suitability for academic investigation</em>: Some questions are not possible to answer through academic enquiry, for example “How beautiful is the colour orange?” Identify a few keywords related to your proposed research question and conduct a general search to determine if there is published and accessible research outputs related to your question.<br>
</li>
<li><em>Attainability</em>: Make sure that your question can be answered taking the amount of time you have. For example, “How do we solve global disease?” is too broad. Whereas, “What is my neighbour’s favourite colour” is too narrow. You will be looking to target between 8 to 15 scholarly references to prepare an annotated bibliography, including books, journal articles and reputable web site references in support of your analytical essay.</li>

<div class="cell" type="reflect">

<div class="reflect">
<p>Some of your best advocates on campus or online are the librarians who work at the Norma Marion Alloway Library in Langley. They are extremely knowledgable about finding things that are hard to find, so it is ALWAYS a good idea to talk to a librarian about what you are trying to do. They are literally paid to help you succeed! One of the ways they like to help is by creating what is known as a ‘LibGuide’, and I encourage you to <a href="https://libguides.twu.ca/LibraryOneSearch" target="_blank">access their LibGuide on using the search feature on the library website.</a>.</p>
<p>Take some time to browse the <a href="https://www.twu.ca/academics/library" target="_blank">TWU Library</a> website.</p>
<p>See if you can find the answer to the following questions:<br>
- Is it possible to borrow or download an e-book? - I’m a distance student. Can I request to have books or articles sent from the TWU Library to my location?<br>
- Do you have books in languages other than English?<br>
- Do you have e-books?<br>
- Can I Email a Trinity Western librarian anytime with my research questions?<br>
- What is AskAway? - What do I do if I have trouble logging in to library databases from off-campus?</p>

<p>Improving search skills will save you time and result in more productive searches. Although we focus on LitMaps and the TWU Library in this course, another tool we want to share is the Google search engine. It provides a number of features to improve your searches in finding academic resources. In this activity, you will select two open resources using the Google advanced search operators in support of your research topic.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Read the <a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/seo/google-advanced-search-operators-cheat-sheet/" target="_blank">Google advanced search operators cheat sheet</a> and try a few searches using the operators.

<li>Go back to the Google Advanced Search web interface and remove words from the search, for example “skills” or “school” and compare the results.</li>
<li>Click on tools and find results for the date range 1 May 2020 to 1 May 2023</li>
<li>Click on images and find versions which are licensed for reuse with modification (useful when sourcing images for your course blog with the necessary legal permissions for reuse).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Search Engines</strong>:<br>
- <a href="https://scholar.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a> is a good search engine to find scholarly publications. The downside is that Google Scholar does not distinguish between closed and open resources. However, search results which show a pdf next to the listing will probably provide access to a full text version.<br>
- <a href="https://unpaywall.org/" target="_blank">Unpaywall</a> is a free and legal way to identify authored-uploaded pdfs. There are extensions for the Chrome and Firefox open source browsers. Read the frequently asked questions for more information.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evaluating-resources">Evaluating Resources</h2>
<p>A key part of finding and selecting resources is evaluating the resource. There is a great deal of information available on the Internet. Some of it is very credible and useful. However, there is a lot of misinformation and poorly researched information online too. As you become more skilled at academic online searching and locating materials you will become quicker at determining what information is useful and credible.</p>
<p>So how do you evaluate the sources to ensure you are using credible sources? The following technique called, the CRAAP test, will help you evaluate the sources you find.</p>

<p>Wikipedia is the free online encyclopedia created through collaborative effort of contributors from around the globe. Wikipedia is one of the most popular websites in the world. When conducting general Internet searches, Wikipedia articles will frequently be listed in the top results.</p>
<p>Anyone registered on the Wikipedia site can create a new article page. Anyone can edit a Wikipedia article, and registration is not required to edit existing articles.</p>
<p>There have been a number of studies examining the accuracy of Wikipedia articles. Notwithstanding the outcomes of these studies, many educational institutions will not accept the use of Wikipedia as a credible source for academic writing and research. In this section we invite learners to evaluate whether Wikipedia is a trustworthy resource and to form a justified opinion on its use as a reliable resource for academic writing.</p>

Fact-Checking Online Resources


Media, as a form of communication, is never ideologically neutral. Therefore,  it is important to develop critical skills to analyse and evaluate media online. Media literacy also encompasses the skills of creating media, so we encourage learners to participate in the optional photo challenge for each pathway in this micro-course.

<p>Now that you have a handful of references to keep track of, it’s time to get started with Zotero to help you manage your references. I promise that learning to use a reference manager like Zotero will save you MANY hours per semester, and likely days or weeks over the course of your degree. Do <em>Future You</em> a huge favour and get in this habit now.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="download-and-install-zotero">Download and Install Zotero</h3>
<p>The RIS file you exported from LitMaps isn’t going to be very useful unless you have software that can read it properly. Your best option is Zotero as it is free and open source and has a good number of plugins and integrations you can use to connect with other apps.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://zotero.org" target="_blank">zotero.org</a> and click the red ‘Download’ button. Then follow the instructions to install Zotero on your computer. If you want to sign up for free storage (300MB) and backup for your library, you can also do that here.</p>
<p>Once you have installed Zotero, there are some plugins that will help you in your studies. These are listed below with links to instructions on how to install and configure the plugin.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="http://zotfile.com/#how-to-install--set-up-zotfile" target="_blank">Zotfile</a> - allows you to find and manage PDFs in your Zotero library</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/eschnett/zotero-citationcounts#installing" target="_blank">Citation Counts Manager</a> - automatically update citation counts for items in your library</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/scitedotai/scite-zotero-plugin#installation" target="_blank">scite.ai</a> - provides a breakdown of how references are cited in the literature</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that you have Zotero ready to go, it’s time to import your first references. Find the ‘untitled.ris’ file in your downloads folder and double-click it to open. You might have to confirm that you want to open with Zotero.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that each journal system will name the downloaded file differently, but they should all end in .ris.</p>

<p>OER, or Open Educational Resources, refers to freely accessible and openly licensed educational materials that can be used, shared, and modified without cost. These resources include a variety of digital assets, such as textbooks, lecture notes, multimedia content, and assessment tools. The key features of OER include their open licenses, which typically allow users to <strong><em>retain, reuse, revise, remix</em></strong>, and <strong><em>redistribute</em></strong> the content.</p>

<p><strong>Revise</strong> the right to adapt, adjust, modify, or alter the content itself (e.g., translate the content into another language)</p>
<p><strong>Remix</strong> the right to combine the original or revised content with other open content to create something new (e.g., incorporate the content into a mashup)</p>
<p><strong>Redistribute</strong> the right to share copies of the original content, your revisions, or your remixes with others (e.g., give a copy of the content to a friend)</p>

<li><p><strong>Affordability</strong>: OER mitigates financial barriers for students by providing access to educational materials at no cost. This is particularly significant as the high cost of traditional textbooks and learning resources can be a substantial financial burden for students.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accessibility</strong>: OER promotes equitable access to educational content globally. Anyone with an internet connection can benefit from OER, fostering inclusivity and addressing issues of accessibility in higher education.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Customized Learning Materials</strong>: Instructors can tailor OER to align seamlessly with course requirements, creating a personalized learning experience for students.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Community Collaboration</strong>: OER encourages collaborative knowledge-sharing among educators and students, fostering a sense of shared learning within the academic community.</p></li>
<li><p>**Current and Relevant Content: OER’s adaptable nature facilitates easy updates, ensuring educational materials reflect the latest advancements, providing students with up-to-date information.</p></li>
<li><p>**Global Perspectives: The inclusive design of OER integrates diverse global viewpoints, enhancing cultural awareness and expanding students’ understanding of various academic frameworks.</p></li>
<li><p>**Ethical Usage: OER operates with transparent licensing, ensuring ethical use of materials and upholding the principles of academic integrity.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, OER offers a cost-effective, flexible, and collaborative approach to educational resource development, making it a valuable and impactful asset in higher education.
