### **Welcome to LDRS 500 Leadership Foundations.**

In this course, we will analyze fundamental concepts and key theoretical approaches to leadership. We will begin with definitions of leadership, and then study servant leadership theory, which is the foundational leadership theory for the Master of Arts in Leadership Program.

We will focus on self leadership, and you will engage in self-assessment about the traits, skills, and behaviours that make great leaders. We will  study three important leadership theories: _servant leadership theory, leader-member exchange theory_ and _authentic leadership theory._ We will also consider how our worldview shapes our thinking about leadership, and how we can create inclusive teams as leaders.

We will dive into the scholarly literature about leadership, consider the thought leaders who influence leadership in our professional contexts, and consider how we can apply leadership concepts and values in our own sphere of influence as leaders.

In this course, we will focus on the following:

1. Defining Leadership
2. Servant Leadership
3. Self Leadership
4. Inclusive Leadership
5. Relational Leadership

### **Defining Leadership**

Definitions of leadership since the early 1900s reflect evolving understandings of people, process, power and society. While the complexity of leadership is undeniable, in your Master of Arts in Leadership program, we will not only study leadership theory, but also explore ways we can apply leadership strategies in order to become effective leaders.

### **Scholarship and Practice**

In our study of leadership, we will examine a wide range of scholarly writing. This scholarly inquiry into leadership will be accompanied by a review of case studies, and synthesis of this learning with our own experiences. Our studies will also provide an opportunity to consider exemplars from the social, economic, political and virtual public spheres. We also draw on the leadership example of Jesus as the ultimate example of a servant leader.

Anyone who has had the experience of being a leader likely agrees with Brown (2019) who argues that, “Regardless of the complexity of the concepts, studying leadership is way easier than leading” (p. 4).

According to Brown, (2019) all leaders share the common experience of vulnerability – an experience that Brown (2018) argues is central not just to the experience of leadership, but also to life. Attending to this vulnerability is an important part of our growth as leaders, according to Brown (2019).

> “Adaptability to change, hard conversations, feedback ,problem solving, ethical decision making, recognition, resilience, and all of the other skills that underpin daring leadership are born of vulnerability” (Brown, 2019, p. 43). What we need, Brown (2019) argues, are “braver leaders and more courageous cultures” (p. 6).

In the Master of Arts in Leadership program, you will engage in higher ordered thinking and analysis. The complexity of leadership is undeniable and the study of leadership includes theories, skills, and application. The MA Lead program is based on Servant Leadership approach, grounded in values and ethics.

### **Birkman Assessment**

Your Birkman assessment will be reviewed and used to guide your development in this course and the Master of Arts in Leadership program. As an applied leadership program, we will constantly encourage you to relate concepts to practice. That means we want you to use what you are learning in your own leadership practice. This focus on _praxis_ will help you leverage your learning throughout the program and engage in authentic personal leadership development to prepare you for the impact you want to make in your team, organization, or community.

As we begin this course, take a moment to consider the type of leader you want to be in five years. Let’s get started!

### **Unit Learning Outcomes**

- Northouse, P. G. (2022). _Leadership: Theory and practice_ (9th ed.). Sage.

Other online resources will be provided in the unit.

  

### **Introduction to Course Learning Activities**

Before we dive into our discussion in definitions of leadership, we want to be sure you familiarize yourself with the ways in which you will learn in this course.

In this course, you will engage in learning experiences that build on each other. These learning experiences are designed to ensure you move forward in the process of achieving the course learning outcomes. Learning experiences include Learning Activities and Learning Assessments.

### **Learning Activities**

In Learning Activities, you will be introduced to new concepts, often through reading scholarly texts. You will also reflect, analyze and apply your new learning, often through Reflective Journals and engagement in the Discussion Forums.

**There are two categories of Learning Activities:**

**Formative Learning Activities (Ungraded)** include activities such as reading, viewing short videos online, and completing personal assessments related to leadership. You will also be asked to write your reflections in a Reflective Journal, which is designed to provide a space for you to think deeply about what you are learning. Formative Learning Activities provide you with a foundation of learning and prepare you for your Graded Learning Activities and Learning Assessments (Assignments).

**Graded Learning Activities (Graded)** include activities such as Discussion Posts and Learning Assessments (Assignments). You will be asked to complete written discussion posts each week, and respond to other learners to deepen your learning and engage in dialogue education. You will also complete graded assignments throughout this course. Be sure to review your syllabus for assignment due dates.

### **Reflective Journal**

A reflective journal is simply a record of your thoughts. It is a reflection of the way you think and the manner in which you respond to your learning.

Throughout this course, you will see prompts to write about certain topics in your a reflective journal. You can use a paper journal to write in, or journal in a document on your computer or device.  Journals can consist of traditional note taking, mind maps, pictures, stream-of-consciousness writing, recordings, quotes, sketches, or drawings: whatever you choose to include. Experiment and have fun.

The purpose of journaling is to make you an active participant in your learning experiences as you engage in the various activities throughout the course’s readings, activities, and discussions with your instructor and your fellow students. Reflecting upon these learning events will help you gain a deeper understanding of the course materials and help integrate your learning into applied practice in your everyday life and work.

Throughout the course, we will remind you to write in your journal, as we want to be sure you are actively learning the material. To assist you, we have provided you with questions you can ask yourself in order to get your creative energies flowing. Reflective journaling is an activity you can and should complete on a regular or daily basis, even outside of our scheduled course activities.

### **Learning Assessments**

Learning Assessments are assignments that allow you to synthesize and demonstrate your new learning, often through assignments such as written papers. Learning Assessments are graded.

## **1.1 Definitions and Theory of Leadership**

### **Defining Leadership**

### **We begin our study of leadership this week with a focus on "Defining Leadership."**

Contemporary ideas about leadership can collectively be characterized as a diverse, interdisciplinary, sometimes contradictory, often complicated conversation. There are many different voices speaking into what leadership is, how it works, and why it matters? While enduring ideas of leadership remain elusive, clear themes have emerged.

One notable synthesis of leadership ideas is offered by Northouse (2022) who defined leadership as, “a process whereby an individual influences a group of individuals to achieve a common goal” (p. 6).

Northouse (2022) argued there are four key components to the leadership phenomenon: “(a) leadership is a process, (b) leadership involves influence, (c) leadership occurs in groups, (d) leadership involves common goals” (pp. 6-7).

**First, leadership is not primarily about a position or authority, but rather it is a process**, or a kind of work, anyone can put into practice. Defined as a process, leadership is something that happens between people—specifically, it is an interaction between the leader and followers. We will explore this in detail in unit 5 on relational leadership.

**Second, the nature of the leader and follower interaction is characterized by the change effect the leader’s communicative action has on the followers’ thinking, character, and/or behavior.** This influence act is essential, for “without influence, leadership does not exist” (Northouse, 2022, p. 7). The ethical quality of influence is important. LaFasto and Larson (2012) argued a major outcome of leadership is positive social change.

**Third, the context of the leader’s influence is group settings ranging from dyads through to collectives, such as organizations and communities**. We will also explore in this course an additional sphere of influence that Northouse’s definition of leadership doesn’t consider. Manz (1986) argued this missing sphere is self-leadership, which he defined as “a comprehensive self-influence perspective that concerns leading oneself” (p. 589). While leadership is a social phenomenon it is also a personal one.

**Fourth, the leader’s acts of influence are concerned with moving followers towards achieving something together.** That is, leaders lead others in creating a shared vision and working to achieve that vision.

Northouse’s (2022) definition provides a framework for our inquiry. We will think together about the process of leadership – how leaders cast a vision, as well as how leaders influence others to achieve that vision. You have likely engaged with or observed leaders who excel in inspiring others to achieve more than they thought possible. In this course, we will study how and why that happens. We will consider both the academic scholarship about leadership, and the practical application of that scholarship.

### **What is a Theory or Theoretical Perspective?**

In this class, we will study several theories about leadership. But what is a theory? In graduate education, we engage in scholarly reading, thinking, and writing focused on continual review and analysis of research conducted by scholars, as well as research we conduct ourselves. One key component of scholarship is the development and analysis of theoretical frameworks. Theories are developed by researchers to explain phenomena, systems, experiences, etc. Theories are a way of explaining what, why, or how something happens.

Plano Clark and Creswell (2015) define theory as something that “explains and predicts the probable relationship among different concepts (variables)” (p. 490).

Theories are developed by researchers who offer an explanation that other researchers then test in additional research studies. Through this process, theories are proven or disproven. Scholars who study leadership have developed theories to explain the process and experience of leaders and followers.

Perhaps the most common theories you have heard about leadership focus on whether leaders are born or made. One theory is that someone is a “born leader.” In this widely held theory, one is either born a leader, or not. Contrasting that, others argue “leaders are made, not born.” From this perspective, a wide range of people have the potential to become leaders through personal growth, intentional development, or mentoring.

From an academic perspective, theories about leadership seek to explain how leadership differs based on the underlying values and beliefs about the leader, the follower, and the reason for the work or goal of the team, organization, or community. These theories provide models for our thinking about leadership.

In our course text, _Leadership: Theory and practice_, Northouse (2022) provides an overview of several leadership theories, summarizing and synthesizing the literature published by researchers who have studied leadership throughout decades.

In this course, we will focus on three leadership theories: servant, authentic, and leader-member exchange. We will also consider three general approaches to conceptualizing leadership, including traits, skills, and behavioral approaches.

Each theory and general approach we will study incorporates both principles and values, which we will analyze throughout this course. The emphasis of our study will be servant leadership, which is a multi-dimensional theory. Authentic and leader-member exchange are complementary theories, which will help deepen the concepts of self and relational leadership. We will also consider how our leadership theorizing connects to values demonstrated in the Christian faith.

  

**Activity 1.1 : Reading**

- Read: Northouse (2022) - Chapter 1- Introduction
- As you read, consider Northouse's (2022) definition of leadership. Begin to reflect on the differences between assigned and emergent leaders, as well as differences between leadership and management. You will be writing about these key concepts in your Unit 1 Discussion Forum.

  

## **1.2 Assigned and Emergent Leaders**

While we often think of leaders as those in an official position of leadership (for example: a vice president of a company, a surgeon leading a medical team, a pastor of a church, or a principal of an elementary school), leadership involves more than simply a position or job. Indeed, those who lead or influence others often are _not_ in positions of leadership. Consider, for example, the friend who always suggests a new book to read, event to attend, or place to go. That friend is a leader.

Consider Brene Brown (2019), author of the _Daring to Lead_. Brown is a faculty member at University of Houston, but her influence extends well beyond the students she teaches. Brown, who has authored multiple best-selling books, has become a thought leader about trust, vulnerability, belonging, and leadership.

Within our organizations and communities, there are people who emerge as leaders: others trust them, are inspired by them, or listen to them. These people often (but not always) transition into formal leadership positions.

Likewise, some people in positions of leadership do not have influential leadership. They may be able to coerce or force others to follow them, but they have not gained the trust of those they lead. Frequently, over time these people transition out of formal leadership positions.

Northouse (2022) provides these definitions:

1. **Assigned Leadership:** "Leadership that is based on occupying a position in an organization is assigned leadership" (Northouse, 2022, pp. 8-9).
2. **Emergent Leadership**: "When others perceive an individual as the most influential member of a group or an organization, regardless of the individual's title, the person is exhibiting emergent leadership" (Northouse, 2022, p. 9)

In this unit's discussion, you'll be asked to consider examples from your own life, so begin thinking now about when you have served as an assigned leader, and when you've been an emergent leader.

  

## **1.3 Leadership and Management**

Leaders direct, shape, and sustain teams, organizations, and communities. They set the vision (or lead others in the process of creating a vision), develop teams, guide those teams in the process of achieving the vision, and inspire and equip others to achieve more than they imagined possible. Leaders play an important role in all our organizations, including government, schools, healthcare, industry, education, places of worship, non-profits, commerce, communities, families, and the playground.

In this course, you will be challenged to reflect deeply about the role of leaders, the type of leader you want to be, and the theory of leadership that aligns most closely with your experiences or aspirations for leadership. You'll consider what it means to lead yourself, as well as the importance of relational leadership.

### **Management and Leadership**

Before we dive into leadership approaches and theories, we begin here with a discussion of the differences between management and leadership. Leadership and management share many similarities, such as influence, collaboration, and meeting goals (Northouse, 2022). However, leadership and management also differ in significant ways.

Whereas management focuses more on planning, budgeting, human resource allocation, and organizing the operations of an organization, leadership focuses more on casting a vision, maximizing staff development, and inspiring others to achieve organizational goals (Northouse, 2022).

Management is an essential component of a thriving organization, as it is focused on "order and consistency" (Northouse, 2022, p. 17).

Likewise, leadership is essential to an organization's growth and longevity, with a focus on "change and movement" (Northouse, 2022, p. 17).

As you engage in the learning activities for this week, reading Northouse’s (2022), be sure to focus on the differences between leadership and management – and how you see both elements reflected in your own organization. Consider your own focus as a leader. Are you primarily engaged in activities that are focused on leadership or management?

  

## **1.4 Worldview Perspectives**

Every person bases his or her own thoughts, decisions, and actions on what is called a worldview. A worldview is “an interpretive framework through which one makes sense of themselves, other people, and the world around them” (Geisler & Watkins, 2003). It is like a pair of glasses that you wear when you are observing things about yourself, other people and the world in which you live.

Here is a short video by the Impact 360 Institute (2014) that explains “What’s your worldview?”

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXnSE0uvwzM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXnSE0uvwzM)

A discussion about worldview, or your perspective, is foundational to understanding how you make sense of the world and leadership. Your worldview shapes your leadership point of view, which is your core system of beliefs about how you view and seek to influence both yourself and others.

Worldviews are an expansive phenomenon, however, Christian philosopher Ronald Nash (1999) argued, they generally “contain at least five clusters of beliefs, namely, beliefs about:

- God,
- Metaphysics (ultimate reality),
- Epistemology (knowledge),
- Ethics,
- And human nature” (p. 14).

While each person's worldview is unique, Sire (2020) described nine common worldview themes, including Christian theism, deism, naturalism, nihilism, existentialism, eastern pantheistic theism, new age, spirituality without religion, postmodernism, and Islamic theism. This course and the MA leadership program as a whole will emphasize Christian theism as a way to illustrate the significance and implications of worldview thinking and its integration with leadership thought and practice.

A Christian worldview asserts God exists, God is the ultimate reality, God created the world and everything in it, and that truth is arrived at through a study of God’s specific revelation (the Bible) and general revelation (creation). Christians believe not only in studying and understanding truth, but they also believe in a personal God that has revealed Himself through this created world.

The Christian worldview can be summarized in three words: Creation, Fall and Redemption. Put simply, when God created the world, it was all good and whole and harmonious. God created people in His own image. Originally people were created healthy in body, soul and spirit (Genesis 1:26-27, 31). As people rebelled against God, causing the Fall, the presence of sin corrupted all aspects of God’s good creation, and brought about much suffering. Where there was formerly harmony and wholeness, we now experience ourselves, our relationships and the world around us as fractured, broken and full of dis-ease (a literal discomfort with who we are) (Genesis 3).

Despite the brokenness, Christians believe that God is actively working to bring about restoration and wholeness to His entire creation. Through Christ’s redemptive work on the cross, people are reconciled to God and are challenged to make all things as they were created and meant to be – very good. Redemption means that all things are made new in Christ (Colossians 1:19-20).

The framework of Creation, Fall and Redemption is important because it allows us to enter into a discussion about leadership with confidence knowing that God’s redemptive work touches this area. Christians believe that we are called to study the world with the desire to take the knowledge we gain and use it to help and bless others; to work toward the restoration and healing of God’s creation.

The Christian worldview has numerous leadership applications. For example, the Christian view that God is personal asserts God is concerned with human leadership activity and its role in the restoration of human relationships. Valk (2010) argued "human activity in conjunction with divine activity creates the possibility for humans and the earth to flourish, for both were created good" (p. 85). The implication of this view of a human and divine personal relationship for leadership is the belief "leadership ... initiates restoration and redemptive work conjoined with divine action" (p. 85).

Another significant example is the Christian belief that God created people in His own image. The implication for leadership is the belief that "“leadership … entails not domination or exploitation of people or of the earth but caretaking, nurturing, guiding, and directing the unfolding of human creativity and potential” (Valk, 2010, p 83). This belief has been influential in the develop of leadership theory, having directly given shape to others-focused conceptions of leadership.

It is beyond the purpose of this course to go deeper into this topic other than to make the point that our way of knowing and understanding the world around us (i.e., our worldview) influences how we approach all of life, including how we approach our understanding and practice of leadership.

  

### **1.5 Your Leadership Story**

In this course, you will engage in deep reflection about who you are as a leader -- and who you want to become. You'll be challenged to engage with deep questions, to reflect on leadership theories, and to self-assess your own leadership strengths.

For the final assignment in this course, you will share your own Leadership Story. (To learn more about that assignment, review the instructions for "[Assignment 2: My Leadership Story](https://learn.twu.ca/mod/assign/view.php?id=967461).")

Throughout this course, you will engage in several Learning Activities to help you begin to think about your Leadership Story. This week, we will start with creating a visual timeline.

  

### **Activity 1.2: Create a Visual Timeline**

- Create a visual timeline of your own leadership journey. In this course, you will be sharing your Leadership Story in your final assignment. You will learn more about this assignment in Unit 4. This week, you will begin reflecting on your leadership journey. For this learning activity, design a visual of your leadership. Using an infographic software or your own drawing skills, create a visual that portrays a timeline of your own leadership journey. Consider your journey from childhood until today. What leadership positions did you hold? In what ways did you lead others? At what stages did you grow as a leader?
